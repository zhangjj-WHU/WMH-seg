### Installation
To get started, it's recommended to create a Python (preferably v3.6) environment using either Conda or venv. This helps to manage dependencies and ensure a consistent runtime environment.

Once environment is active, install the required packages from `requirements.txt` using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
