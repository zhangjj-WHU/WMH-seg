# WMH-seg: 

## A Robust Automated Segmentation Method for White Matter Hyperintensity of Vascular-origin

### Installation
To get started, it's recommended to create a Python (preferably v3.6) environment using either Conda or venv. This helps to manage dependencies and ensure a consistent runtime environment.

We run our WMH-seg on a system running Ubuntu 18.01, with Python 3.6, PyTorch 1.8.1, and CUDA 10.1. 

Once environment is active, install the required packages from `requirements.txt` using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The dataset will be released via the Zenodo repository:(DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.15221380)
